    <p>Corduroy is a teddy bear in a department store. One day a little girl asks her mother if she can buy the bear. her mother says no and points out that his overalls are missing a button. The girl came back the next morning with a piggy bank and buys Corduroy. She brings him home, makes him a bed and sews on a new button for his overalls and they become best friends.</p>
