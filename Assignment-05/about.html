    <p> Don  Freeman (the artist)  is known to many people as the author of Corduroy and other childrenâ€™s books. He was also a graphic artist who vividly portrayed the street life and theater world of New York City in the 1930s and 40s. On this website, I try to present these different aspects of my father who died in 1978, but whose work is still alive.</p>
