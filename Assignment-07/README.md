I have come across many forms while browsing the web. Forms are used when you log into websites, when filling out shipping information for orders online, or even when using and creating a comment in the comment section of social media sites like facebook or instagram, etc. Forms create much more structure for all these buttons and fields that can be filled out. I think forms also make it easier to submit the filled in information by letting you submit everything all at once rather than submitting each field you filled out individually.


1. Plain Text; this creates a text box so that users can type in information. When used with the paragraph element it can be used to display text in front of a text box.
2. Passwords; This creates a single line entry text that hides typed characters with a '*'.
3. Text Area; allows users to type longer responses
4. Radio Buttons; allows users to select one item from a list
5. Checkbox; allows users to select and deselect zero, one, or more options from a list
6. Select Box(Dropdown select); allows users to pick one option from a dropdown list
7. Upload Button; allows users to open a navigation window, select a file, and upload it to the URL
8. Submit Button; this button sends a form to a server
9. Image Button; allows users to use an image as a submit button
10. Button Element; allows users more control over how their buttons appear
