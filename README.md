Repository for my Intro to Web Design homework.
This week we learned about different file types and made a repository for our homework on GitHub. At first, I did not realize that the instructions for the homework on the course website was made up of slides, so I was not looking at all the steps at first and was confused. Once I figured out that each instruction had multiple slides, then everything made sense and went great.
