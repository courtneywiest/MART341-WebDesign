I liked learning HTML, I thought it was really fun. There are so many tags and elements that it is hard to remember them all, but writing each one down in my notes makes them easier to locate.

I would say maybe I am a little bit anxious for CSS just because I don't know what it is like yet. I think though, it will be just like learning HTML, or any other program I've had to learn, everything is a little overwhelming at first and then I slowly get more comfortable and confident.
