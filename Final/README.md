Pretty much everything that we learned this semester was new to me. It was confusing at first, but now that I really understand how things work, it's a lot of fun!

I would say that I was pretty familiar with web design. I am media arts student so I'm familiar with color theory and complimentary fonts etc.

I had lots of different challenges while working on the final. I used the internet, the knowledge that I have, and messing around to find the answers that I needed to be able to do what I wanted.
