A border helps define the amount of space a box or element takes up, as well as its relationship to other boxes. The border can be separately colored, and has multiple style options. Padding is the amount of space between the inner content of the element and the element itself. A margin is the space between the box/element and other elements, or the edge of the parent element.

At first I had a little bit of trouble thinking of what elements I was going to make for my website. I ended up going pretty simple and I think, kind of fun. While working on the website I had a small problem where all my elements shifted a little bit and I couldn't figure out why. I ended up undoing multiple steps until I got back to where I was before everything shifted, and just started again from there, and everything worked okay.
