Three websites that I enjoy visiting are, instagram.com, facebook.com, and pinterest.com.
A DNS links a websites domain name, for example, instagram.com, with the website's IP address. This makes it so that users do not have to remember the lengthy IP address number. 
A cookie is a small packet of data that is created by a web server and placed onto a user's computer by the web browser. Cookies enable servers to store all different kinds of information, like items in a shoping cart, login information, payment information, etc. 
The three essential parts to a URL are the protocol, domain name, and path. 
Three things I have learned so far: 1. A website's domain name and IP address are linked, enabling the website to be accessed through the domain name. 2. Web directories are organized like file systems on a computer are organized. 3. Cookies are placed on a user's computer by a web browser in order to store information that the user needs, for example, items in a shopping cart.
