A universal selector element is used to style every element on the page. The asterisk (*) is often used in computer science to mean "all." An element selector is used to select all the elements in a document of a certain type. For example selecting h2 will style every header2 in the document. Class names can also be used to style certain elements. When using this, a dot (.) goes in the front of the class name. ID selectors work the same as a class selector. This selector lets you define the style for a specific element. ID names have a number sign (#) before the unique ID name.

I chose a pastel palette. I found a page on the Sherwin Williams website that had some popular colors of the 50's.

The three colors are:
1. Classic French Gray: #888782
2. Radiant Lilac: #a489a0
3. Sunbeam Yellow: #f0d39d.
