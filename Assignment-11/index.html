        <p>When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was
        breathless, who was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with
        the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee
        squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her
        curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold and it made her
        voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot   struggles of the poor.

        <p>"I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved
        her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me
        over, but she didn't, because she was in love with me too. She
        thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her. .
        . . Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in
        love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn't care. What was
        the use of doing great things if I could have a better time
        telling her what I was going  to do?"
