A system font is a font that is already installed onto your local device system. Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server. A web-safe font is a font that developers can count on being available in all systems.

Having fallback fonts is important because if a system does not have the font that you used, then you can use your fallback font and it can look very similar to still achieve the look the designer is going for.
